# Pac Man Project

This project challenge was to be able to generate DOM elements for the Pacmen and then to be able to move them around the screen bouncing back and forth.

I decided to take it a little further by adding a PacMan subtract button, and creating an enclosed area for them to bounce around.  I also added the animation of them eating.

## Future Improvements

I would like to have the pellets from the original Pacman game 'falling' down from the top of the pacmen area and every time one of the pacmen collide with the pellets it gets added to a score counter.
